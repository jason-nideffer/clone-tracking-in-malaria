library(ggplot2)
```

Initially, I harmonized along the "cohortid" variable and then performed clustering on all the data. The problem with this 
was that some subjects were stimulated with beads and some were not, and the bead stimulation has a massive effect on transcription.
As a result, individuals that had no bead stimulated condition had artificially high frequencies of "TCR-Activated" cells due to 
harmony batch correction.

Below, instead, I try clustering without harmony.

```{r}
rna_tcr <- readRDS("../../Processed_Data/FROM_STEP_5_Scaled/rna_tcr_scaled.rds")

# PCA
rna_tcr <- RunPCA(rna_tcr)

# Cluster
rna_tcr <- FindNeighbors(rna_tcr, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:40)
rna_tcr <- FindClusters(rna_tcr, resolution = 4.0, verbose = FALSE)

saveRDS(rna_tcr, "../../Processed_Data/FROM_STEP_6_Clustered/rna_tcr_clustered.rds")
```
